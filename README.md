## My process and what I learned

I created an XD File before coding to create a prototype of the design. I also drew the containers for each element on the page to provide a visualization of how everything is structured before I code.

I learned how to use th <picture> tag for loading time for picture sizing and responsive states. 


### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- Some BEM CSS class naming convention
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use these lines of code:

```html
      <picture>
        <source media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg">
        <img src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum perfume bottle layed flat next to palm leaves.">
      </picture>
```
```css

```


### Continued development and resources

In the future, I want to be able to have faster workflow.
